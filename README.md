# 5-Stage-Pipelined-MIPS32-RISC-Processor

# ðŸš€ MIPS32 RISC Processor â€“ 5-Stage Pipelined Architecture

This project implements a **MIPS32-based RISC processor** with a classic 5-stage pipeline using Verilog. The design simulates instruction-level parallelism and is suitable for understanding pipelining, hazard handling, and basic CPU architecture.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The processor is based on a reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture with the following pipeline stages:

1. **IF** - Instruction Fetch  
2. **ID** - Instruction Decode  
3. **EX** - Execute  
4. **MEM** - Memory Access  
5. **WB** - Write Back  

It includes support for a variety of arithmetic, logical, memory, and branch instructions similar to the MIPS32 ISA.
